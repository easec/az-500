Demonstration- Storage Security

In this demonstration, we will explore storage security configurations.
Task 1: Generate SAS tokens

Note: This demonstration requires a storage account, with a blob container, and an uploaded file. For the 
best results upload a PNG or JPEG file.
In this task, we will generate and test a Shared Access Signature.

1. Open the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to your Storage Account.
3. Under Settings select Access keys.
4. Explain how Storage Account access keys can be used. Review regenerating keys.
5. Under Settings select Shared access signature.
6. Explain how an account level SAS can be used. Review the configuration settings including Allowed services, Allowed resource type, Allowed permissions, and Start and expiry date/times.
7. Back at the Storage Account page, under Blob service select Containers.
8. Right-click the blob file that you want to share and select Generate SAS.
9. Click Generate SAS token and URL.
10. Copy the Blob SAS URL. There is a clipboard icon on the far right of the text box.
11. Copy the URL into a browser and your file should display.

Task 2: Key Rollover
Note: Always use the latest version of Azure Storage Explorer.
In this task, we will use Storage Explorer to test key rollover.

1. Download and install Azure Storage Explorer - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/
2. After the installation, launch the tool.
3. Review the Release Notes and menu options.
4. If this is the first time using the tool, you will need to Reenter your credentials.
5. After you have been authenticated you can select the subscriptions of interest. Explain Storage Explorer can also be used for Local and attached accounts.
6. Right click Storage Accounts and select Connect to Azure storage. Discuss the various connection options.
7. Select Use a storage account name and key.
8. In the portal select your storage account.
9. Under Settings select Access Keys. Retrieve the Storage account name and key1 key.
10. In Storage Explorer, provide the account and key information then click Connect.
11. Verify that you can browser your storage account content.
12. In the portal and your storage account.
13. Under Settings select Access Keys.
14. Next to key1 click the Regenerate icon.
15. Acknowledge the message that the current key will become immediately invalid and is not recoverable.
16. In Storage Explorer refresh the storage account.
17. You should receive an error that the server failed to authenticate the request.
18. Reconnect so you can continue with the demonstration.

Task 3: Storage Access Policies
In this task, we will create a blob storage access policy.
1. In the Portal, navigate to your Blob container.
2. Under Settings, select Access Policy.
3. Review the two policies: Storage access policies and Blob immutable storage.
4. Under Stored access polices click Add policy.
5. Create a policy with Read and List permissions and usable for a restricted period of time.
6. Under Blob immutable storage click Add policy.
7. Review the two policy types: Time-based retention and Legal hold.
8. Create a policy based on the time-based retention.
9. Be sure to Save your changes.
10. In Storage Explorer, right-click your container and select Get shared access signature.
11. Notice the Access Policy drop-down lets you create a the SAS based on a pre-defined configuration.
12. As you have time, show how Storage Explorer can be used to perform security tasks.

Task 4: Azure AD User Account Authentication
In this task, we will configure Azure AD user account authentication for storage.
1. In the portal, navigate to and select your blob container.
2. Notice at the top the authentication method. There are two choices: Access key and Azure AD User Account. Explain the differences between the two methods.
3. Switch to Azure AD User Account.
4. You should receive an error stating you do not have access permissions.
5. Click Access Control (IAM).
6. Select Add role assignment.
7. Select the Storage Blob Data Owner role. Discuss the other storage roles that are shown.
8. Assign the role to your account and Save your changes.
9. Return to the Overview blade.
10. Switch to Azure AD User Account.
11. Notice that you are now able to view the container.
12. Take a minute to select Change access level and review the Public access level choices.

Task 5: Storage Endpoints (if you haven't already done this 
in the Network lesson)
Note: This task requires a storage account and virtual network with subnet. Storage Explorer is also 
required.

In this task, we will secure a storage endpoint.
1. In the Portal.
2. Locate your storage account.
3. Create a file share, and upload a file.
4. Use the Shared Access Signature blade to Generate SAS and connection string.
5. Use Storage Explorer and the connection string to access the file share.
6. Ensure you can view your uploaded file.
7. Locate your virtual network, and then select a subnet in the virtual network.
8. Under Service Endpoints, view the Services drop-down and the different services that can be secured with an endpoint.
9. Check the Microsoft.Storage option.
10. Save your changes.
11. Return to your storage account.
12. Select Firewalls and virtual networks.
13. Change to Selected networks.
14. Add your virtual network and verify your subnet with the new service endpoint is listed.
15. Save your changes.
16. Return to the Storage Explorer.
17. Refresh the storage account.
18. Verify you can no longer access the file share.
